# Demo Mode Status Explanation

## Current Status: Sources: 0/6 connected, Articles: 11

### What This Means:

- **Demo Mode is Active**: The application is running in demo mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`)
- **Articles Are Working**: You're seeing 11 articles from demo data across all sources
- **Connections Were Showing as 0/6**: This was a display bug - sources should show as connected when demo data is available

### ‚úÖ Fix Applied:

Modified the `getSourceStatus()` method to properly handle demo mode:

- Sources are now considered "connected" if they have demo data loaded
- This should now show "6/6 connected" in demo mode

## Demo vs Production Mode

### Demo Mode (Current):

- ‚úÖ No API keys required
- ‚úÖ Instant setup and testing
- ‚úÖ Realistic sample data
- ‚úÖ All source types represented
- ‚ùå Not real-time data
- ‚ùå No actual API connections

### Production Mode:

To enable real connections, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false` in `.env.local`

**Available with API Keys:**

- NewsAPI: Real news articles (key already configured)
- CryptoPanic: Real crypto news (key already configured)
- CoinDesk: Ready for implementation
- Binance WebSocket: Real-time market data (no key needed)

**Available without API Keys:**

- GDELT: Global news (needs proper API endpoint)
- UN Environment: RSS feeds (needs CORS proxy)

## Recommended Actions:

### For Testing:

1. Keep demo mode enabled
2. The source connection status should now show correctly
3. All news functionality works with demo data

### For Production:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false`
2. Verify your API keys are working
3. Set up a CORS proxy for RSS feeds
4. Implement proper error handling for failed connections

## Source Status Indicators:

- üü¢ **Connected**: Source is providing data (real or demo)
- üî¥ **Disconnected**: Source failed to connect or has no data
- üü° **Pending**: Source is attempting to connect

The fix ensures that in demo mode, all sources with demo data appear as connected, giving you a proper preview of how the production system will behave.
