## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ RSS feed aggregation from crypto_feeds.csv
- ✅ Article categorization and filtering
- ✅ Responsive sidebar design
- ✅ Social media service structure
- ✅ API routes for both RSS and social feeds
- ✅ Error handling and logging

### Limitations
- ⚠️ Binance APIs currently blocked by CloudFront (403 errors)
- ⚠️ Twitter/X integration not implemented (requires API access)
- ⚠️ Reddit feeds handled via RSS rather than API

### Next Steps
1. Alternative social media data sources (public APIs, web scraping)
2. Twitter/X integration when API access is available
3. Additional social media platforms (YouTube, Telegram, Discord)
4. Enhanced error recovery and retry logic

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the APIs:
   ```bash
   # RSS feeds
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/crypto-rss
   
   # Social feeds (will show empty due to API blocking)
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/social-feeds
   ```

3. Test the responsive sidebar:
   - Open the app in browser
   - Resize window to test different breakpoints
   - Check category filtering and article display

## Technical Details

### Responsive Breakpoints
- `w-full`: Mobile/tablet (default)
- `md:w-96`: Medium screens (768px+)
- `lg:w-[50%]`: Large screens (1024px+) - **Half width**
- `xl:w-96`: Extra large screens (1280px+) - **Fixed width**

### Category System
- **News**: Traditional news sources
- **Blog**: Personal blogs and opinion pieces
- **Magazine**: Long-form articles and analysis
- **Social**: Social media posts (Reddit, Twitter, Binance Square)
- **Analysis**: Technical and market analysis
- **Market**: Trading and price-related content
- **Tech**: Development and protocol updates

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when APIs are blocked
- Logging for debugging
- Partial failure handling (some feeds can fail without breaking others)
- Timeout handling for slow APIs

This implementation provides a robust foundation for crypto news aggregation with room for expansion as more social media APIs become available.
