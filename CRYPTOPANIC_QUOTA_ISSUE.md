# CryptoPanic API Quota Issue

## Problem
The CryptoPanic API is returning a 403 Forbidden error with the message:
```json
{
  "status": "api_error",
  "info": "API monthly quota exceeded - Upgrade your API plan: /developers/api/plans/"
}
```

## Root Cause
- The CryptoPanic API key `7871d4a29d1195df86b86cd30aece7d07da33fc4` has exceeded its monthly quota
- This is a limitation of the current API plan level

## Current Solution
1. **Temporarily disabled CryptoPanic** in the real-time news service configuration
2. **Added alternative RSS sources** to compensate:
   - Bitcoin Magazine RSS
   - Decrypt RSS
   - Existing CoinDesk RSS
   - Existing CoinTelegraph RSS

## Enhanced Error Handling
Updated the `fetchFromCryptoPanic` method to:
- Detect quota exceeded errors specifically
- Provide clear logging messages
- Gracefully handle the error without breaking the app

## To Fix Permanently
1. **Upgrade CryptoPanic API plan** at https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/plans/
2. **Wait for quota reset** (monthly renewal)
3. **Re-enable CryptoPanic** in the configuration by uncommenting the source

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Use CryptoPanic RSS feed** instead of API (free but limited)
2. **Implement RSS parsing** for CryptoPanic's public RSS feeds
3. **Replace with other crypto news APIs** like CoinAPI or CryptoCompare

## Current Status
- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ News feed still works with GNews + RSS sources
- ❌ CryptoPanic API disabled due to quota
- ✅ All other news sources working properly

## Code Changes Made
- Updated `realTimeNewsService.ts` to handle quota errors
- Temporarily commented out CryptoPanic source
- Added Bitcoin Magazine and Decrypt RSS feeds
- Enhanced error logging for API quota issues
